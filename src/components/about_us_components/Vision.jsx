      We envision a world where waste plastics are no longer seen as a problem
      but rather as a valuable resource. Our goal is to empower individuals to
      actively participate in the recycling process, creating a positive
      impact on the environment while also benefiting from their efforts. By
      utilizing blockchain technology, we provide a transparent and secure
      platform that connects waste collectors with recycling companies,
      creating a circular economy that promotes sustainability.
